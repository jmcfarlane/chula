<project name="Chula">
    <release date="" version="0.4.0">
        <log>Added simple wrapper around couchdb-python</log>
        <log>
            Added support for couchdb session store.  This means you
            now can choose between PostgreSQL/Memcached or
            CouchDB/Memcached.
        </log>
        <log>Added singleton decorator</log>
        <log>Added initial logging support</log>
        <log>
            Added a regex style url mapper.  This means you can now
            choose between automatic class mapping and hand crafted
            mappings via regular expressions (this should be similar
            to Django style routing).
        </log>
        <log>Updated memcache.py to version 1.45</log>
        <log>
            Fixed regression in chula.www.cookie where the cookie
            domain was getting prefixed with "." once for every cookie
            - oops.
        </log>
        <log>
            Refactored session into a package.  When the couchdb
            backend was added, not all of the failover logic was being
            implemented.  To clean things up properly the session
            logic had to be abstracted away from the backends.  Now
            there is a single session class that supports n number of
            backends that all use the same interface.
        </log>

        <log>
            Changed behavior to always call the error controller on
            exception.  This is slightly less convienent, but encourages
            better testing of error handling code paths for apps using
            Chula.
        </log>

             <br/>
             <i>Note that this
             feature is probably going to be moved into a FileMapper so
             the StandardMapper can move to more of a map based
             model.</i>

        <log>Add render method to pager.Pager for those that want to
             subclass the output.  The base method simply returns the
             pager unmodified.
        </log>
        <log>Remove "danger" logic from db.py as it's best left up to
             the consumer to handle that type of logic.  It was poorly
             implemented anyway  :)
