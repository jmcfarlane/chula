Chula v0.10.0
+++++++++++++

*Released 2011-06-16*

- Fixed **major** defect in the http status header sent by
  :mod:`chula.www.adapters.fcgi.adapter` and
  :mod:`chula.www.adapters.wsgi.adapter`.  Prior to this fix it
  appears the status code would look something like ``404 OK`` in the
  event of a not found error condition.  The code had ``OK`` hard
  coded, and thus wasn't taking into consideration the actual status.
  This is now fixed using :attr:`httplib.responses` for the W3C string
  representations of the status code(s).
- Set psycopg2.extensions.{UNICODE,UNICODEARRAY} globally in
  :mod:`chula.db.engines.postgresql`.  This considerably simplifies
  unicode struggles when downstream code doesn't know what encoding
  was used.  With this change all data returned by psycopg2 will be of
  type :class:`unicode` instead of :class:`str`.
- Switched the :attr:`chula.config.Config.auto_reload` logic to fully
  reload everything.  Previously there were situations where
  code imported by model classes was not getting reloaded.  **This is
  currently experimental, and might eat your computer**.
- Improved :meth:`chula.www.controller.error.Error._crappy_static_server`
  so it can serve almost any static content (hypothetically).  For
  sure it can serve html files, which was sadly not supported
  previously.
- Improved :command:`chula-run` to use Gevent's wsgi server
  (http://www.gevent.org/gevent.wsgi.html) when available.  If not
  available the builtin :mod:`wsgiref.simple_server` is used.
- Added a default :class:`chula.logger.Logger` instance to
  :class:`chula.www.controller.base.Controller`.
- Added logging for 404 failures when
  :meth:`chula.www.controller.error.Error._crappy_static_server` is in
  use.
- Added logging for unhandled exceptions in controller methods
  decorated as a webservice, via :func:`chula.webservice.expose`.
- Added a :meth:`chula.www.controller.error.Error.e404_render` method
  to the base error controller for custom rendering while still using
  :meth:`chula.www.controller.error.Error._crappy_static_server` for
  testing.
- Added a skeleton application for use as a reasonable starting
  place for a hello world type application
  (https://github.com/jmcfarlane/chula/tree/master/apps/skel).

Chula v0.9.0
++++++++++++

*Released 2011-03-24*

- Added :program:`chula-run` to serve a Chula application using
  Python's reference :mod:`wsgiref.simple_server`.  Remember this is
  just for debugging and developing.  When running your application
  for real you'll want to use something like :ref:`nginx_fastcgi`.
- [`GH-19 <http://github.com/jmcfarlane/chula/issues#issue/19>`_]
  Added :mod:`chula.www.controller.error` as a default error
  controller.  This provides basic static content handling as well as
  [crude] stack trace formatting in html when debugging is enabled.
- Added support for :attr:`chula.config.Config.auto_reload` to make coding
  even funner.
- Removed dependency on setuptools, now we only use :mod:`distutils`.
- [`GH-16 <http://github.com/jmcfarlane/chula/issues#issue/16>`_]
  Improved logging.  Both error and debug logging use files.  This
  fixes the long standing stderr blocking issue.
- Improved build process to reference build artifacts directly from
  pypi.
- [`GH-20 <http://github.com/jmcfarlane/chula/issues#issue/20>`_]
  Fixed :class:`chula.nosql.couch.Documents` to use ``document=value``.

Chula v0.8.0
++++++++++++

*Released 2010-12-26*

* Added support for couchdb-python-0.7.0 (api changes).
* Added support for raw (json/xml) http posts
  (`GH-17 <http://github.com/jmcfarlane/chula/issues#issue/17>`_).
* Added support for the Python provided json library (now the default).
* Added support for "zero config" CouchDB access.  Previously the code
  would raise an excception of the server url was not specified, now
  it assumes http://localhost:5984 if no configuration is provided.
* Added support for optional webservice indentation when using the
  JSON transport.  This is useful for situations where you prefer to
  have payload you can actually read, and are ok with the performance
  impact.
* Exposed :attr:`chula.config.Config.log_level` in the config object.
* Improved `nosql.couch` class constructors to avoid kwargs overflow
  (`GH-18 <http://github.com/jmcfarlane/chula/issues#issue/18>`_).
* Improved the :doc:`getting_started` documentation a bit.
* Improved name of queue msg purging exception to be more accurate.
* Removed old xml based changelog and doc files.
* Removed support for Python-2.5 (though you can still use it).

^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Released 2010-05-07*

* Updated the manifest to include apps, and test cases
* Added support for Google App Engine.
* Added ability to fetch data from CouchDB using views
* Removed dependency on pytz.
* Removed usage of :func:`socket.gethostname`, which can have a
  negative impact on performance (especially in heavily threaded
  applications).  This also makes it possible to use Chula in
  environments that do not have access to :mod:`socket`.
* When looking for :mod:`simplejson`, also try using the copy that
  ships with Django.
* Updated the logger to not use a file handler when
  :attr:`chula.config.Config.log` is ``None``.
* Fixed defect in Couchdb connection cache.
* Performance improvements to :mod:`nosql.couch`

Chula v0.4.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Released 2010-02-10*

* Added simple wrapper around couchdb-python
* Added support for CouchDB session store. This means you now can
  choose between PostgreSQL/Memcached or CouchDB/Memcached.
* Added singleton decorator
* Added initial logging support
* Added a regex style url mapper. This means you can now choose
  between automatic class mapping and hand crafted mappings via regular
  expressions (this should be similar to Django style routing).
* Added (initial) documentation using Sphinx (not yet published)
* Updated memcache.py to version 1.45
* Fixed regression in chula.www.cookie where the cookie domain was
  getting prefixed with "." once for every cookie - oops.
* Refactored session into a package. When the CouchDB backend was
  added, not all of the failover logic was being implemented. To clean
  things up properly the session logic had to be abstracted away from
  the backends. Now there is a single session class that supports n
  number of backends that all use the same interface.
* Moved third party libs (fcgi, selenium, memcache) into chula.vendor

Chula v0.0.3
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Released 6/15/2008*

* Added module for working with caching services, currently only
  Memcache is supported.
* Added support for controllers inside of packages, previously only a
  single namespace was supported.  Note that this feature is probably
  going to be moved into a FileMapper so the StandardMapper can move to
  more of a map based model.
* Added render method to pager.Pager for those that want to subclass the
  output. The base method simply returns the pager unmodified.
* Remove "danger" logic from db.py as it's best left up to the
  consumer to handle that type of logic. It was poorly implemented
  anyway :)

  :attr:`chula.config.Config.add_timer`)
